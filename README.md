# Factions Reborn

Factions Reborn, formerly known as zNexusFactions, is a variation of Factions, the idea was suggested on the Bukkit 
forums by @LeCastlecrafter.

## How it works

Basically, it has almost all the features of the original Factions plugin and also with a twist! Factions can not 
only be raided but they can be destroyed, not just the base but the whole Faction! Faction bases are also quite 
different, there is no claiming rather the size of the base depends on Faction experience points and player counts. A
base also consists of a vault with a nexus located in the middle of it.

#### The Vault

The vault is a 5x5x3 enclosed area which has the Nexus in the middle of it, the vault is the most secure location in 
a faction base especially when the offline-defence is active. By default the vault is located in the middle of the 
base when a new faction is created, however a vault can be moved around.

#### The Nexus

The Nexus is the heart of a faction, if destroyed the faction will be destroyed as well with the exception of the 
grace period.
